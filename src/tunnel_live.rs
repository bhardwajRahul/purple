//! Live-data layer for active SSH tunnels. Two worker types:
//!
//! - One stderr-parser thread per tunnel that reads `ssh -v` output and
//!   emits `ChannelEvent`s when ssh logs `debug1: channel N: new` and
//!   `debug1: channel N: free` lines. Also keeps the last few stderr
//!   lines so `poll_tunnels()` can surface a meaningful exit reason.
//!
//! - One shared lsof poller that runs `lsof -iTCP -P -n` every 2s,
//!   filters by the active tunnel bind ports and emits `LsofMessage`
//!   snapshots with connected clients and port conflicts.
//!
//! All communication is via `std::sync::mpsc` channels. No tokio.
