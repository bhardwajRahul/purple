//! Canonical footer keycap labels.
//!
//! Single source of truth for the text shown next to every keycap in TUI
//! footers. Inline strings in `src/ui/*.rs` are forbidden. every footer
//! must reference these constants so the same key in different screens
//! shows the same label.
//!
//! Categories follow the design-system-reference.md "Footer keycap" rule:
//! - `back`  . leaves a navigated overlay and returns to its parent
//! - `cancel`. discards form/picker input or selection state
//! - `close` . closes a self-contained info overlay (no state)
//!
//! All values include the surrounding spaces the `Footer` builder expects
//! (` select `, not `select`).
