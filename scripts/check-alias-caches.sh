# Inventory gate for host-alias-keyed candidate collections on App state.
#
# Background: App::reload_hosts is the single place where every cache
# keyed on an SSH host alias is pruned when the host list changes. A
# new HashMap<String, _>, HashSet<String> or Arc<Mutex<HashSet<String>>>
# field on an App-state struct is a CANDIDATE for that contract.
# It may turn out to be keyed on a container id, provider name, group
# label, or something else entirely and need no prune. The point of
# this gate is to force a conscious classification on every addition.
#
# Scope: src/app.rs and any src/app/**/*.rs (recursive). New App-state
# files anywhere under src/app/ are scanned automatically.
#
# Multi-line tolerance: vault::cert_cache declares its type across
# several lines because the value is a complex tuple. A naive line-grep
# would miss it. The preprocessor below joins continuation lines of any
# `pub <name>:` or `pub(in crate::app) <name>:` declaration so the regex
# sees a single line per field.
#
# How to resolve a failure:
#   1. Decide whether the new field is keyed on a host alias. Trace
#      its insertion sites and cite what gets put in.
#   2. If alias-keyed: prune it in src/app.rs::reload_hosts AND seed
#      the ghost-sweep contract test
#      (handler::tests::reload_hosts_ghost_sweep_clears_every_alias_keyed_collection).
#   3. Add the new path:field to EXPECTED_LIST below, with a one-line
#      comment classifying it as alias or non-alias.

set -e

# Every String-keyed HashMap/HashSet on an App-state struct lives here.
# Sorted alphabetically. Comments mark whether the field is alias-keyed
# (= must prune) or keys on something else.

# Classification notes (kept out of EXPECTED_LIST so the diff stays clean):
#   alias, pruned in reload_hosts:
#     container_state::cache, ping::status, ping::last_checked,
#     file_browser_state::host_paths, tunnel_state::summaries_cache,
#     tunnel_state::demo_live_snapshots, vault::cert_cache,
#     vault::cert_checks_in_flight, vault::cert_stat_throttle,
#     vault::sign_in_flight,
#     containers_overview::auto_list_in_flight,
#     containers_overview::collapsed_hosts,
#     containers_overview::in_flight_aliases (on refresh_batch).
#   alias, self-pruning:
#     tunnel_state::active (worker drops entry when tunnel process exits).
#   transient, scoped to one picker session, reset on screen exit:
#     key_push_state::selected,
#     snippet_state::selected (SnippetHostPick: reset on picker open via
#     reset_host_pick, cleared on Esc; never read after the run commits).
#   non-alias keys:
#     containers_overview::entries (x2 on InspectCache and LogsCache),
#     containers_overview::in_flight (x2 same caches): container id.
#     host_state::group_host_counts: group label ("Tag: prod" etc).
#     host_state::group_alias_map: outer key is group label; aliases live
#       in the Vec<String> value and follow hosts_state.list automatically.
#     provider_state::syncing, sync_history, expanded_providers: provider name.

# Preprocessor: join multi-line `pub <name>:` field declarations onto
# one line so the candidate regex below sees the full type.
# State machine: when a `pub <name>:` line opens with unbalanced `<` or `(`,
# accumulate subsequent lines until the balance closes and the buffer ends
# with `,` or `;`. Emit `<file>:<start_line>:<joined>`.
